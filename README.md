# Optical Flow Visualization

This project calculates and visualizes optical flow between two consecutive images. Optical flow is a technique used to detect motion between images.

## Contents

- `main.py`: Calculates and visualizes the optical flow.
- `filters.py`: Contains edge detection filters.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for optical flow calculation.
- `generate_consecutive_frames.py`: Generates consecutive frames with random shapes.

## Requirements

You need the following Python libraries to run this project:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy scipy
